# Building local-first app

Cloud applications let us collaborate in real time and from different devices. But we can't use them at all when we're offline, and we no longer have control over our stuff â€” the software provider does. For developers, cloud applications require knowledge of countless technologies, tools and frameworks while only letting us choose from a very small number of providers.

Traditional installed applications give us control over our stuff, but limit us to a single device, so it's clumsy to work with others. And it's our job to make sure that our data is backed up somewhere.

Local-first applications give us the best of both worlds. Collaborative applications that are fast, responsive, work offline and are easy to deploy. In this talk we will look at the emerging protocols and technologies of the local-first web and how developing an app might look like.
